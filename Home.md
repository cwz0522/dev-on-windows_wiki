## Development on Windows

In this wiki various guides can be found to set up a good Windows development environment.

All tools and libraries will be installed in `C:\dev\`, you can move this if you'd like (I'd suggest not to), but make sure to keep it a __short, ASCII-only path without any spaces__. Some parts may break if you don't follow this guideline. From this point on and in all other places we will  use `C:\dev\` - substitute for whatever directory you ended up using.

I can also suggest to create `C:\dev\bin` and adding it to your path. You can then drop small executables/scripts there to run anywhere from the command line.
