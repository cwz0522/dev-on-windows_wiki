Python is a great programming language, and used in many tools.

Luckily, installing it is very easy. Go to the [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of both Python 2.x and Python 3.x, and run both installers. Choose install for all users unless you know for sure you want the other option.

Then, by default it will suggest to install in `C:\PythonXY\`. Install in `C:\dev\PythonXY\` instead.
