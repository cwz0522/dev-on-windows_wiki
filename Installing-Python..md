Python is a great programming language, and used in many tools.

Luckily, installing it is very easy. Go to the [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of both Python 2.x and Python 3.x, and run both installers. Choose install for all users unless you know for sure you want the other option.

Then, by default it will suggest to install in `C:\PythonXY\`. Install in `C:\dev\PythonXY\` instead.

The installer will ask you what features you want installed. Select all, and also make sure you tick _'Add python.exe to Path'_.

Manually make sure Python3 comes __after__ Python2 in the `PATH`. Then go to your Python3 installation directory and __copy__ `python.exe` and `pythonw.exe` to `python3.exe` and `python3w.exe`.
