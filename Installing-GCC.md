GCC is a very good compiler collection for Windows, and is fully free (in speech and beer). There are however a ton of distributions spread over the internet, but only some are of high quality. There's a lot of choices to be made as well, so I've made all those for you so you don't have to worry, and get good defaults.

I assume your machine is 64-bit, and you want your compiler to target 64-bit windows by default. We will install both a 32-bit and a 64-bit compiler.
